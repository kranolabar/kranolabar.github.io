            <h1><strong>THE SCRUB CODE</strong></h1>
            <p><strong>
                As laid forth by the Master Scrubs, the original four: Messrs Sinon, Chong, Choo and De Jesus.
                And added upon by the Lesser Scrubs, the later four: Messrs Tan, Teo, Ranola and Chia,
                to aid us all in our conduct and bearing as gentlemen Scrubs:
            </strong></p>
            <ol start="0">
                <li>Always talk about the Scrub Club.</li>
                <li>The Scrub Code shall be honoured.</li>
                <li>What happens in the Scrub Club stays in the Scrub Club, especially every and any display photo of the group.</li>
                <li>A Scrub has no principles in logic, reason and/or rationale. A Scrub just does things. </li>
                <li>A Scrub does not partake in cock blasters outside the Scrub Club.</li>
                <li>A Scrub does not mention his girlfriend in the Scrub Club. Any mention is punishable by expulsion.</li>
                <li>A Scrub shall always be known as a Scrub. Any further variations such as 'scrubber', 'scrubby', 'scrabak' etc, shall be reserved as secondary adjectives.</li>
                <li>A Scrub shall only ever be a man. A woman who possesses characteristics of a Scrub is not called a Scrub, but a Scrubette.</li>
                <li>The night on 19 December 2016 shall forever be remembered as the Night of Immeasurable Scrubbatry. It shall always be brought up during Scrub meet ups, greetings or any festivities where two or more Scrubs are gathered.</li>
                <li>A Scrub shall never be ashamed of the scrubby moments in his scrabak life of scrubbatry.</li>
                <li>Anything can happen with a Scrub. Everything will happen with a club of Scrubs.</li>
